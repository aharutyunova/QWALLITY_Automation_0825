#  During program creation create your own list, tuple, dict, set.

#1 Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.(write logic)
list_1 = [10, 20, 40]
sum = 0
for i in list_1:
    sum += i
print(sum)

# Anna - Correct

#2 Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list.
list_2 = [10, 20, 10, 20, 30]
newlist_2 = set(list_2)
print(newlist_2)

# TODO Correct, you could also convert the result back to list

#3 Write a Python program which print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements. 
list_3 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 
del list_3[4:6]
del list_3[0]
print(list_3)

# TODO: This works, but instead of hardcoding slices, you can remove the exact indexes. 
#       Start deleting from the biggest index so the positions of other items donâ€™t change.

#4 Write a Python program to get the difference between the two lists.
l1 = [1, 2, 3, 45]
l2 = [2, 45, 6]
l12 = set(l1).difference(set(l2))
l21 = set(l2).difference(set(l1))
print(l12.union(l21))
# Anna - Correct

#5 Write a Python program to convert a tuple to a dictionary.
tuple_1 = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
dict_1 = {}
index = 0 
for i in tuple_1:
    dict_1[index] = i
    index += 1

print(dict_1)
# TODO: Correct. You could also do it more simply by keeping the data as a tuple of tuples and converting it to a dict.


tuple_dict = ((1, "applce"), (2, "banana"), (3, "cherry"))
print(dict(tuple_dict))

#6 Write a Python program to add an item in a tuple.
tuple_2 = (1, 2, 5)
list_6 = list(tuple_2)
list_6.append(8)
newtup = tuple(list_6)
print(newtup)

# TODO: You can also add 8 to a tuple directly using +, without converting it to a list first.
"""
new_t = tuple_2 + (8,)
print(new_t)"""


#7 Write a Python program to add a key with corresponding value to a dictionary.
mydict_7 = {0: 'apple', 1: 'banana', 2: 'cherry'}
mydict_7[8] = 'fruit'
print(mydict_7)

# Anna - Correct

#8 Write a Python program to get the maximum and minimum value in a dictionary.
mydict_8 = {"apple": 10, "banana": 20, "cherry": 5}
print(max(mydict_8.values()))
print(min(mydict_8.values()))

# Anna - Correct


#9 Write a Python program to create a union of sets.
setA = {"apple", "banana"}
setB = {"cherry", "banana"}
setC = {"a", "b"}
union_ABC = setA.union(setB, setC)
print(union_ABC)

# Anna - Correct

#10 Write a Python program to create dict with your name, age, address, education, and two phone numbers.
my_info = {
    "name": "Anush",
    "age": 25,
    "address": "Here should be myAdress",
    "education": "Master",
    "phones": ["+37455-000000", "+37491-111111"]
} 
print(my_info)
# Anna - Correct
