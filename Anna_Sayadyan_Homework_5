#  During program creation create your own list, tuple, dict, set.
#1 Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.(write logic)
my_list = [39, 45, 62, 47, 63, 2, 0, 15]
sum = sum(my_list)
print(sum)

# TODO: Correct, but I expected you to write the logic of sum here

#2 Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list.
list2 = [50, 6, 90, 50, 2, 9, 6]
new_set2 = set(list2)
print(new_set2)

# TODO Correct, you could aslo convert the result back to list

#3 Write a Python program which print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements.  
list3 = [5, "hello", 25.9, "bye", 852, 692, 5, 20, 8]
result = list3[1:4] + list3[6:9]
print(result)

# TODO: This works, but instead of hardcoding slices, you can remove the exact indexes. 
#       Start deleting from the biggest index so the positions of other items donâ€™t change.

#4 Write a Python program to get the difference between the two lists.
list4 = [54, 85, 63, 74, "hi"]
list5 = ["hello", 54, 89, "hi"]
list6 = list(set(list4) ^ set(list5))
print(list6)

# Anna- correct

#5 Write a Python program to convert a tuple to a dictionary.
tuple_for_convert = (("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3))
converted_dict = dict(tuple_for_convert)
print(converted_dict)

# Anna- correct

#6 Write a Python program to add an item in a tuple.
my_tup = (5, 9, "hey")
new_tup = my_tup + ("add",)
print(new_tup)

# Anna- correct

#7 Write a Python program to add a key with corresponding value to a dictionary.
cosmetics = {
    "Name brand": "Rare beauty",
    "Name product": "Blush",
    "Name color": "Hope"
}
cosmetics["Value"] = "35$"
print(cosmetics)

# Anna- correct

#8 Write a Python program to get the maximum and minimum value in a dictionary.
dict_min_max = {
    "N1": 25,
    "N2": 54,
    "N3": 5,
    "N4": 19,
    "N5": -8,
    }
print(f"Max Value : {max(dict_min_max.values())}, Min Value : {min(
    dict_min_max.values())}")
# Anna- correct

#9 Write a Python program to create a union of sets.
tropical_fruites = {"Mango", "Passion fruit", "Lychee", "Papaya"}
temperate_fruites = {"Apple", "Strawberry", "Apricot"}
print(tropical_fruites.union(temperate_fruites))

# Anna- correct

#10 Write a Python program to create dict with your name, age, address, education, and two phone numbers. 
my_personal_dict = {
    "Name": "Anna",
    "Age": 25,
    "Address": "Yerevan, Armenia",
    "Education": "Finances, ASUE",
    "Phone numbers": ["+37477741852", "+37477852963"]
}
print(my_personal_dict)

# Anna- correct
