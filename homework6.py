# 1.	Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.
# Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
# Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
# Expected Output : 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
# numbers = [0, 1]
# while True:
#     next_number = numbers[-1] + numbers[-2]
#     if next_number > 50:
#         break
#     numbers.append(next_number)
# print("Fibonacci series up to 50:", numbers)

# Anna - Correct

# 2.	Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the
# number of digits and letters.
# Sample Data: Python 3.13
# Expected Output:
# Letters 6
# Digits 3
# new_text = input("Please input a text: ")

# sum_of_letters = 0
# sum_of_digits = 0

# for i in new_text:
#     if i.isdigit():
#         sum_of_digits += 1
#     elif i.isalpha():
#         sum_of_letters += 1

# print("Letters", sum_of_letters)
# print("Digits", sum_of_digits)

# Anna - Correct

# 3.	Write a Python program to print alphabet pattern 'L'
# Expected Output:

# 4.	Write a Python program that reads two integers representing a month and
#  day and prints the season for that month and day.
# Expected Output:
# Month: July(7)

# Season: Summer

# 5.	Write a Python program to find the median of few values.
# Expected Output:
# numbers: 15, 26, 28, 33   or   1, 4, 5, 6, 7

n = len(numbers)
median = 0
if n % 2 == 0:
    median = (numbers[n//2 - 1] + numbers[n//2]) / 2
